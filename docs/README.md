`TIME` is assumed to be in 24hrs format.

## Listing Tasks
Displays all the tasks in the list.
**Usage:** `list`
- Each task has a __index number__ to identify the task in the list
- __Index number__ is used to refer to a task in other commands


## Marking and Unmarking tasks
Tasks in the list can be marked as done, or unmarked to set it as undone.

Marked tasks will be labeled with `[X]` and unmarked tasks are labeled with `[]`

**Usage:**
- `mark INDEX`
    - Marks the task at index number `INDEX` as done.
- `unmark INDEX`
    - Marks the task at index number `INDEX` as undone.

Examples:
- `mark 2` - marks the second item as done
- `unmark 1` - marks the first item as undone


## Deleting tasks
Tasks in the list can be deleted using the keyword `delete`

**Usage:** `delete INDEX`
- Deletes the task at with index number `INDEX`

Examples:
- `delete 1`  - deletes the first item

## Finding tasks
Finds tasks in the tasklist containing the specified keyword.

**Usage:** `find KEYWORD`
- Note: `KEYWORD` provided by the user is case sensitive

Examples:
- `find midterm` - returns a list of tasks containing the word `midterm`.
- `find essay` - returns a list of tasks containing the word `essay`.

## Quitting the application
**Usage:** `bye`
- The program will close 1.5 seconds after sending this command.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Will the list of tasks be saved?**
A: Yes, the list will be saved automatically after each command. They will be loaded again when the user launches the application again.

**Q: Where is the savefile?**
A: The savefile is a file named `duke.txt`, and can be found in the same folder where `Duke.jar` is stored, under a folder called `data`.

**Q: Can I edit the savefile?**
A: It is not recommended to edit the savefile as this may corrupt the data stored inside. If memory is corrupted, a fresh savefile will override the corrupted one, and all old data will be lost.
