### Editing the data file
Task data are saved as: `<Type> | <status> | <description> | <date and time>`
- `Type`The mapping of task to type is as follows
  - Todo - `T`
  - Event - `E`
  - Deadline - `D`
- `status`
  - `0` indicates task is undone
  - `1` indicates task is done
- `description` cannot be empty
- `date and time` is only for events and deadlines

‚ùó The data format **must be followed strictly** or the app could simply create a new task list and overwrite current data with this new list or behave abnormally (e.g. not displaying task information correctly).

Tip: Try adding a few tasks and inspect the data format and follow them.
