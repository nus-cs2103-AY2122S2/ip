Duke is your personal assistant to keep track of tasks.

## Quick Start
1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `duke.jar` from [here](https://github.com/Gnoznaug/ip/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Duke.

4. Open a command line terminal in the same folder as Duke and run `java -jar duke.jar`. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.

5. Type the command in the input box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing list and pressing Enter will display the task list. Some example commands you can try:
- `list`: Lists all tasks.
- `todo read book`: Adds a todo task to the task list.
- `delete 2`: Deletes the 2nd task shown in the current list.
- `bye`: Exits the app.

## Features

> Notes about the command format:
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> - If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but if you specified it multiple times, only the first occurrence of the parameter will be taken. The `update` command is the exception where the syntax has to be adhered to strictly.
> - All date inputs has to be in the yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2022-10-21.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as list and exit) will be ignored.
    e.g. if the command specifies `bye 123`, it will be interpreted as `bye`.
