# User Guide
Duke is a desktop app for managing tasks, deadline and events. It features a stunning Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is themed around the CS2103 module, with the chat assistant being Prof. It will save the states of all tasks upon successful exit and will automatically load all tasks from the previous session.

## Features 
**Notes about the command format:**
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `todo NAME`, `NAME` is a custom parameter that the user should supply (e.g. `todo homework`).


### Viewing help

Accessible via a `?` symbol next to the text field. It will spawn a text by Prof explaning all available commands.
