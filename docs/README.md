## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest `jarvis.jar` from [here](https://github.com/NatalieTanML/ip/releases/tag/A-Release).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Jarvis.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The application GUI should appear in a few seconds.
5. Type the command in the input box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `list` and pressing Enter will display the task list.
   Some example commands you can try:
   - `list`: Lists all tasks.
   - `todo submit project`: Creates a Todo called `submit project` to the task list.
   - `mark 1`: Marks the first task as done.
   - `event project meeting /at 2022-12-31 2359`: Creates an Event called `project meeting` scheduled for 31 December 2022, at 11:59pm.
   - `bye`: Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
> - Words surrounded with angled brackets such as `<TODO_NAME>` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. The brackets themselves are not part of the command input.
> - All datetime inputs are to be formatted as `yyyy-MM-dd HHmm`, e.g. `2022-12-31 2359`.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the input is `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
