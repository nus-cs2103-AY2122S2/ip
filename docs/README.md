## Usage 

**Notes about the command format:**
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. <br>
  e.g. in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `todo homework`.
* Items in square brackets are optional. <br>
  e.g. in `deadline DESCRIPTION /by DATE [TIME]` can be used as `deadline work /by 2022-12-12` or as 
  `deadline work /by 2022-12-12 2359`
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters
 (such as `help`, `list`, `bye`) will be ignored. <br>
 e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
