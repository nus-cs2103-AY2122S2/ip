### `mark` - Marks a task as done

Format: `unmark INDEX`

Example of usage:

- `unmark 3` marks the third task as not done.

### `delete` - Deletes a task

A valid index is a positive integer that starts at 1 and ends at the size of the task list,
where the value represents its position in the task list.

### `find` - Searches for tasks

Searches for a task using a string query.
The command will return all tasks that have a matching sequence of
characters as the query string. The query is case-insensitive.

The `DATE_TIME` argument follows the date and time formatting. See [date and time component](#date-and-time-component).

Format: `edit INDEX [-d TASK_NAME] [-t DATE_TIME]`

Example of usage:

- `edit 1 -d Grab dinner` edits the description of the first task.

### `bye` - Exits Juke

Format: `bye`

## Date and Time Component

The way date and time is parsed requires a string to be in the given format:

`DAY[D_SEPARATOR]MONTH[D_SEPARATOR]YEAR[ HOUR[T_SEPARATOR]MINUTE]`

Below is the table for the formatting of each element:

|Element|Description|Formats|
|:---:|---|---|
|`DAY`|Day of the month.|`02` (standard), `2`|
|`MONTH`|Month of the year.|`04` (standard), `Apr`, `April`|
|`YEAR`|Year.|`2022`|
|`HOUR`|Hour of the day (24 hr).|`19`|
|`MINUTE`|Minute of the hour. |`30`|
|`D_SEPARATOR`|Date separator. Optional.|space, `-`, `/` (`DAY` and `MONTH` as standard)|
|`T_SEPARATOR`|Time separator. Optional.|space, `-`, `:`|

The entire time component of any date and time is optional.
If time is not specified, it is defaulted to `0800`.

If `MONTH` is given as either of the two string forms, it can be placed before `DAY`.

The output format of time is always in the form `02 Apr 2022 19:30`.
