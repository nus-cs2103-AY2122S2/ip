### Sorting Tasks: 'sort'

Sorts all tasks based on their **priority**. Priority is determined based on the chronological order of their happening time, regardless of the task type.
Particularly, since todo tasks do not have a specified time, their priority will be the lowest. 
If two tasks have the same happening time, their priority will be determined by their alphabetical order.

Format: `sort`
* Sorts and shows all tasks based on their **priority** as defined above.

### Loading and Saving Tasks

When `Ultoi` starts up, it will try to load past task records from your computer. 
If `Ultoi` does not find such a record, it will start from empty.

`Ultoi` automatically saves your changes as you are using, so don't worry that you may lose your past tasks!

### Exit Ultoi: `bye`

Quits the app.

Format: `bye`
* You can either do this or simply close the window to quit the app.
