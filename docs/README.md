### `sort` - Sort the tasks

Sorts the tasks in Duke according to the following sort order:
1) `todo`
2) `deadline`
3) `event`
   If the tasks are of the same type, e.g. both are `todo` tasks, then they are sorted alphanumerically based on their description strings.
   Note that sort returns a new sorted list to be displayed and leaves the original list unchanged.

Example of usage:

`sort`

Expected outcome:
```
Here are your sorted Tasks:
1. [T][] go to sleep
2. [E][] event cry myself to sleep (by: Feb 18 2022 23:59)
```
### `bye` - Exit Duke
Exits the Duke program and saves tasks to to disk.

Note that Duke only saves tasks to the disk when you enter `bye`
and not when you change any tasks. This is a design decision to save number of file accesses.

Example of usage:
`bye`

Expected outcome:
Program closes and your data file is updated.
