## Features 

### Feature - Create new tasks!

Fluffers currently offers 4 types of tasks:

| Task type | Description | Usage | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| To do task | This is the most basic task, like one that you will write on a post it note and paste it on your fridge! | `todo <description>` | `todo E-Learning homework` |
| Deadline task | This is a task with a fixed dateline, so that you know when to finish it by! | `deadline <description> /by <date>` | `deadline Submit E-Learning homework /by 2022-02-14 23:59` |
| Event task | This is an event that has a start and end time! | `event <description> /at <date> /until <date>` | `event Family Dinner /at 2022-03-01 18:00 /until 2022-03-1 20:00` |
| Between task | This is a special task that has to be done between two date/times! | `do <description> /between <date> /and <date>` | `do Mark students' homework /between 2022-05-03 15:00 /and 2022-05-05 23:59` |

**Note that the format of the date must be `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm` exactly!**
