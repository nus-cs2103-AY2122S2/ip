## Features 

### Add, Delete, and View Your Tasks.

In Duke chatbot, you can add any of the three types of Tasks. 
- Todo: A simple task object with only content as argument
- Event: A task object with datetime that the event occurs at
- Deadline: A task object with datetime that serves as a deadline for the task

### Mark Your Tasks

Furthermore, you can mark your task objects as complete using Duke.
- Mark a task marks it as completed
- Unmark a task by using the index number of the task

### Sort Your Tasks

Viewing tasks based on the date is quite important. Urgent items should be addressed first! <br/>
Duke provides a sort feature to let you sort based on the date of the tasks and based on the contents of the tasks.

### Tag Your Tasks with Unique Tags

Duke also allows you to tag your tasks with tags of your own choice. This will allow you to view tasks more 
intuitively based on what the task is about.
- Add tag to a task
- Untag a task using the name of the existing tag

### Keyword Search on Tasks

Sometimes, you need to look through the whole list to find something you needed to do!
With keyword search, you can search for your task with keywords.

### Load Up Your List with Locally Stored File

Duke automatically saves every item in the list of tasks after every action. On application booting, 
Duke loads the save file.
