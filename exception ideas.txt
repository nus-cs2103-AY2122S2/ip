 * Need to create many kinds of LilyExceptions as children
 * LilyNoDescException - didn't type description kind
 * LilyNoDateException - didn't type /by and /at kind
 * LilyInvalidInputException - dont understand your input kind (doesn't match
 * enums)
 * LilyMissingTaskException - (un)marking (operating on) an uncreated task
 * LilyRedundantOpException - marking a marked task, unmarking an unmarked task
 * (you already marked this, silly!)
