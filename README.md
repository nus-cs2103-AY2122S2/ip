# Ultoi

*Ultoi* is a desktop app for **managing tasks**. 
It combines the benefit of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and a Graphic User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, *Ultoi* can help you manage your tasks better than traditional GUI apps.

Refer to `docs/UserGuide.md` for a more detailed user guide.
