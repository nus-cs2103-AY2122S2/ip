[^1]: 
    Should you find the need to change where the data is being saved, edit the `FILE_PATH` and `FILE_DIR` in `Duke.java`.
    ```java
    public class Duke {
        ...

        protected static String FILE_PATH = "./data/duke.txt";
        protected static String FILE_DIR = "./data";
    
    ```
    `FILE_PATH` denotes the actual file, while `FILE_DIR` denotes the folder containing the file.
