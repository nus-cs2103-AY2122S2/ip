Lily is a CLI-based task manager. It attemps to embody the personality of a character in Duolingo of the same name. She is a disinterested teen with purple hair.

- On an emotional scale of 1-10, Lily is *always at a -4*
- Lily's perpetually unamused facial expression has one clear message: stop bothering me
