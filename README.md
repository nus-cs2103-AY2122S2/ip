Duke makes sure that you don't get called out being a sussy baka for not doing your tasks. It's,
- definitely not an imposter
- easy to learn for crewmates
- ~~FAST~~ ***I AM SPEED*** level of usage

All you gotta do is,

1. download it from this definitely not sus [website](https://github.com/Ardentsoul/ip/releases).
2. click on the latest version (currently v0.11) and download the jar file.
3. run cmd.
4. add, delete and find your tasks.
5. let this **CHAD** bot manage your tasks for you ðŸ¤¤ðŸ’¦

Best part is this is **FREE**! ðŸ’¯

Features:

- [x] Manage your sussy tasks
- [x] Manage your todos, deadlines and events
- [ ] Reminders (coming soon maybe?)

#### If you program in the sussy language known as Java, you can use it to practice Java too. Here's the `main` method:
```java
public class Duke {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String home = System.getProperty("user.home");
        new Duke(home,"/DukeSaveDirectory/DukeSaveFile.txt").run();
    }
}
```
