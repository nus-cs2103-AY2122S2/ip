         * Lily's reason for being here: her part time job. school sucks but not as bad as home or here.
         * oh, hold on a sec, someone else is asking me for a coffee or soemthing
         *
         * tension with parents - holes up in room when she gets back. has to hold back what she wants to say in order
         * cuz she doesn't think they care about her, or want to know her.
         * ignores about being the most attractive person
         * doesn't really want to help you, i can't be doing all the heavy lifting, right?
         * have irritating users. and some who are just mean or spiteful
         *
         * make her a hero: personal sacrifice to help you, or take risk and prevail
         * she won't take social initiative
         * one good thing lily helped someone else with
         * one thing lily feels good about herself
         * embarrassing thing lily did in the past
         * someone intro her to fun adventures but she doesn't want to go, went anyway
         *
         * would never intro her father to her friends, cuz he'd say something insensitive
         * put real, strenuous and even frustrating effort into getting the important stuff done. setbacks and snags along the way
         * looked unkempt and mussed up for boring reasons
         * character's emotions
         *
         * attached to a personal object
